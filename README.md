This is a personal project involving creating a functional website to (hypothetically) promote the movie Toy Story 4.  
It is intended to demonstrate a basic level of application of HTML/CSS/Javascript.
Structurally, the site consists of the use of containers/subcontainers as well as descriptive images which on click, lead to corresponding wikipedia pages. 
On hover, a red shading effect is applied visually. 
I also created a simple JavaScript function which would prompt the user to input a rating for the movie in the provided box,
then on button press return the user's rating (a demonstration of attention to user interactiveness).
